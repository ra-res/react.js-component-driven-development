Component Driven Development (CDD) in React

Component Driven Development (CDD) is a popular methodology used in approaching modern website development. If you code using atomic design principles or utilise the benefits of a JavaScript framework, you may already be adhering to some of the principles the method adopts.

At its core, Component Driven Development (CDD) is an all-encompassing concept which applies globally to design systems, pattern libraries and modern JavaScript frameworks, most notably React.

Approaching problems with a Component Driven Development (CDD) first approach has many benefits (Osmani 2017), such as -

   *  Faster development
   *  Simpler maintenance
   *  Better reusability
   *  Lower barrier to entry of understanding
   *  Better modelling of the overall system
